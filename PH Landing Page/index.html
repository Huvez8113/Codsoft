                    <p>
                        IT services can often include software development processes to create custom applications that
                        fulfill specific business needs. For example, a startup business may rely on its IT service team
                        to create a software application for organizing and maintaining venture capitalist records.

                    <p>
                        Cloud services provide many ways for business team members to interact with the technology they
                        need. The cloud is an internet-connected platform that can store and access information and
                        programs. Since the cloud stores the information instead of holding it on a computer, team
                        members can access and use it whether at home or in the office.

                        Many business IT services also include hardware installations, maintenance and repairs. For
                        instance, a corporate IT department is often responsible for installing the computers, hard
                        drives, printers, modems and routers that the company needs to operate. IT teams also evaluate a
                        business's processes to determine the types of hardware that support its needs.

                    <p>
                        Network security services help protect a business' network from unauthorized access. IT services
                        can create and issue access authorization to those who need it. They also provide many other

                        software,Installing virtual private networks (VPNs), Performing regular network checkups

                    <p>
                        Since technology and software can change often, helping your team learn how to operate updated
                        devices and software can help them use those tools efficiently with minimal questions. Many IT
                        services include technology training for business teams that use technical tools and resources
                        for everyday operations. In these cases, an IT team can train staff in your company on how to
                        use specific tools, programs and applications.

                        software applications, programs and online tools. Teams that offer these services often guide
